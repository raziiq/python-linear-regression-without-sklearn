This repo demonstrates the model of Linear Regression (Single and Multiple) by developing them from scratch.

In this Notebook, the development is done by creating all the functions, including Linear Regression for Single and Multiple variables, cost function, gradient descent and R Squared from scratch without using Sklearn.

The results of MSE and R-Squared are then compared by calculated them using Sklearn.
